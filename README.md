# Neural Network


This repository contains a neural network training program built entirely from scratch using numpy with customizable input and output layers, and a customizable number of hidden neurons in a single hidden layer. The program also includes early stopping criteria based on root mean squared error (RMSE). As well as normalization and denormalization of the data is also implemented. The program also includes a train-test split of the data, and a plot of the RMSE after the training. The program is designed to be flexible and easily adaptable to a variety of data sets and modeling goals.
